# FAIR model
This repository contains an implementation of the FAIR model in discrete time domain. All effecting radiative forcing (ERF) are contained in [fair.py](fair.py),due to lack of documentation some constants or ERF aren't implemented. 
The model is intended to be exectuded in a separate file, like in a [jupyter notebook](fair_notebook.ipynb)
